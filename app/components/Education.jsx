                        <li><strong>I have invested time and dedication in participating in several online courses</strong>
                            and training programs to acquire a solid set of technical skills in the field of Front End development. Some of the courses I have completed are:</li>
                        <li><strong>&ldquo;Web design and development technician&rdquo; in Centro de Tecnolog√≠a y Artes Visuales (CETAV): </strong>

I have explored various programming languages, content management systems and workflows, developing competencies in web design and programming with a focus on functionality, accessibility and usability based on web standards.</li>
                        <li><strong>&ldquo;JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures&rdquo; in freeCodeCamp : </strong>
                            This course has provided me with a deep understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, which is crucial for efficient and scalable web application development.</li>
                        <li><strong>&ldquo;Responsive Web Design&rdquo; in freeCodeCamp : </strong>
                            During this course, I gained knowledge about the principles and best practices of responsive web design,
                            enabling me to create user interfaces that adapt to different devices
                            different devices and screen sizes.</li>
